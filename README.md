# Pown.js

The goal of Pown.js is to rapidly create information security tools and develop new security testing and detection techniques by taking advantage of the vast JavaScript software eco-system.

## History

> [@pdp](https://twitter.com/pdp): Pown.js was started in early 2017 as a collection of scripts to scratch a personal itch. At that time I was busy with setting up [SecApps](https://secapps.com) and I had a lot of useful snippets all over the code-base which I wanted to share as an opensource code. So Pown.js was started.

> While the project started in 2017, versions ~0 and ~1 don't have much to show for. The tooling was sort of integrated with the capabilities of SecApps and as a result, it appeared more of extension to a commercial penetration testing software then an opensource project with a life of its own. In Late 2018 and early 2019, the project took a completely different direction with version ~2. Pown is now a lot more independent and set for success.
